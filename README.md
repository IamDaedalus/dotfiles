This repo contains my dotfiles I need whenever setting up a new PC\
There's an install script `setup.sh` that symlinks every config to their\
respective locations based on the contents of the `paths.txt` file

# How to Use
To use for yourself, you'd have to clone this directory to your home and\
change the username in `paths.txt` from **daedalus** to your username.\
Then run the `setup.sh` file and everything should be symlinked where necessary.\
Any changes made to the symlinks will affect the originals so you have no fear\
of losing any changes made while also keeping all configs centralised!
